# nozama-api
Back end for e-commerce site Nozama, the one-stop online shop for all your biking needs.

This app began as a group project for GA Web Development Immersive. The original back-end app is available in the following repo: https://github.com/Group-404/nozama-api

This app was built with Node.js, using Express as a framework for routes and controllers, and Passport for authentication. See package.json for full list of middleware used.

The databases were built with PostgreSQL (for storing relational tables) and MongoDB (for storing sessions).
